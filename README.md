Library Management Project

Overview - The Library Management project is a console-based Java application that allows users to manage a library's collection of books. Users can perform operations such as adding and removing books, updating book information, checking out and returning books, and searching for books by various criteria. This README file provides information on how to set up and use the application.

Features
Add Book: Add a new book to the library's collection.
Remove Book: Remove a book from the library's collection.
Return Book: Return a book to the library.
View All Books: View a list of all books in the library's collection.

Future Enhancements
Actively working on adding additional features and improvements to the Library Management project. Some of the future enhancements include:
  Security Features: We plan to implement more security features, including:
      User Authentication: Require user login and authentication to access certain operations.      
      Access Control: Differentiate access levels based on user roles (e.g., librarian, member).
  Search Book: Search for a book in the library by title, author, or genre.
